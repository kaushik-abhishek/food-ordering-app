In this chapter, I have learnt the following things:
-write the script in the parcel.json and now we can run the npm run start instead of npx parcel index.html
-We learnt, how to write the code with react element, JSX
-How React Code works:
React.createElement => Object => HTMLElement(render)

-JSX: 
    -Javascript syntax which is easier to create.
    -JSX is not HTML and it can't return HTML
    -JSX has HTML like syntax.
-How JSX Code works:
-JSX => React.createElement => Object => HTMLElement(render)
    -Babel convert JSX to React.createElement
-Babel:
    -Parcel transpiled the code with the help of Babel so that JS Engine can understand
What is React Component?
    -Functional component (NEW) : which returns some piece of JSX is known as Functional component.
    -Class base component (OLD)
